Pizza Sales

This is a data analytics project using SQL, Excel, and Tableau.
I generated a dataset using SQL and use the dataset to create a Tableau dashboard, as well as an MS Excel dashboard.

The dataset includes A year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served,
with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.
