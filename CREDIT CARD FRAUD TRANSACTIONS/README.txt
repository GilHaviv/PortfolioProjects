CREDIT CARD FRAUD TRANSACTIONS

This is a data analytics project using SQL, Excel, and Tableau. 
First, I started with Data exploration using SQL to uncover initial patterns, characteristics, and points of interest to help me to create a broad picture of important trends and major points to study in greater detail. 
Then, I generated a dataset using SQL. 
Finally, I used the dataset to create a Tableau dashboard, as well as an MS Excel dashboard.
